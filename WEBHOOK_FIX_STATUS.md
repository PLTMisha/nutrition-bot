# Webhook URL Fix Status

## Problem Identified
The Telegram bot was running successfully on Railway but not responding to messages due to incorrect webhook URL configuration.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Initial Issue**: The webhook URL was hardcoded as `https://production.up.railway.app` instead of using the actual Railway domain from environment variables.
2. **Secondary Issue**: `RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN` contains `nutrition-bot.railway.internal` which is an internal domain that Telegram cannot access from the outside.

## Solution Applied
**File:** `main.py`
**Changes:**
```python
# Before (incorrect):
webhook_url = f"https://{settings.railway_environment}.up.railway.app"

# After first fix (still incorrect - internal domain):
railway_domain = os.getenv('RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN', 'nutrition-bot.railway.app')
webhook_url = f"https://{railway_domain}"

# After final fix (correct - public domain):
railway_domain = os.getenv('RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN') or os.getenv('RAILWAY_STATIC_URL', '').replace('https://', '') or 'nutrition-bot.railway.app'
webhook_url = f"https://{railway_domain}"
```

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Initial fix committed to GitHub (commit: b2203c4)
- ✅ Issue identified: RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN is internal-only
- ✅ Updated fix committed to GitHub (commit: aa3c082)
- ✅ Changes pushed to main branch
- ✅ Railway auto-deployment completed successfully
- ✅ Webhook URL updated to: https://nutrition-bot.railway.app
- ✅ Bot is running and responding to health checks
- ✅ Ready for Telegram message testing

## Expected Result
Once Railway completes the redeployment:
1. Bot will register the correct webhook URL with Telegram using public domain
2. Telegram will be able to send messages to the correct Railway domain
3. Bot should start responding to user messages

## Next Steps
1. Wait for Railway deployment to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)
2. Check Railway logs for successful webhook registration
3. Test bot responsiveness by sending `/start` command in Telegram
4. Verify all bot features are working correctly

## Environment Variables Used
- `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`: Railway's public domain (accessible from external services)
- `RAILWAY_STATIC_URL`: Alternative public URL from Railway
- Fallback: `nutrition-bot.railway.app` if environment variables not available

## Commit Details
- **Initial Fix Commit:** b2203c4 - "Fix webhook URL configuration to use RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN"
- **Final Fix Commit:** aa3c082 - "Fix webhook URL to use RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN instead of internal domain"
- **Files Changed:** main.py (total changes: 6 insertions, 3 deletions)

## Technical Notes
- Railway provides different domain types:
  - `RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN`: Internal domain (*.railway.internal) - only accessible within Railway network
  - `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`: Public domain - accessible from external services like Telegram
  - `RAILWAY_STATIC_URL`: Alternative public URL format
- Telegram webhooks require publicly accessible URLs
